## DQN
Deep Q-Network (Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning. Nature. 2015)

This is an implementation of DQN. I referred to OpenAI's implementation: https://github.com/openai/baselines.

This structure provides a research framework that can extend to new RL algorithms for comparison purposes. Â
